    "description": "Senior Engineer at Avito, I have been developing professionally since 2015, I've started developing in PHP, then in 2019 I switched to developing in Go. I worked in several small startups, as well as in two large companies - CarPrice and now I'm working at Avito. I am interested in development - this is really my hobby, I am also interested in different types of keyboards, I soldered and assembled two keyboards myself, I use orthogonal split keyboards. I type with the ten-finger method, play the guitar (graduated from music school), and play a lot of computer games. I am interested in the gym and travel a lot."
